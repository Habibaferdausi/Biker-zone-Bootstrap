# Biker-zone

Biker Zone is designed to serve as a hub for bikers, providing them with the latest news, reviews, and information on everything related to biking. On the Biker Zone website, you can find a variety of content related to biking, including articles on the latest bike models. In addition to its content, Biker Zone also offers an online store where bikers can purchase a range of products. The website has a user-friendly interface and is easy to navigate, making it an ideal resource for both experienced and novice bikers.

In this website I used HTML5 and CSS framework Bootstrap . This design made from figma file.
